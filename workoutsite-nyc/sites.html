        <p>As soon as the weather warms, New Yorkers move to Central Park where there are walking or running trails and cycling paths. One spot I have used for a workout is close to the 84th street entrance, practically next to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But any relatively flat area with a tree would do - the tree is for fastening your resistance band. </p>

        <img src="cp-tango.jpg" width="100%" height="40%"><p>Another spot for a different kind of a workout is the TANGO place near the East 68th street entrance to the Park, in the plaza with the Shakespeare statue. If you know how to and have a partner to tango with, an hour of tango burns as many calories as an hour on the threadmill and a lot more fun than walking on a band that goes nowhere</p>

            <img src="RI-exercise.jpg" width="100%" height="40%">
            <p>This spot is on the north side of the island next to the soccer field between the two residential complexes of Mahattan Park and the Octagon. The area has a few calistenic equipment that you can use if you want. You will need a mat and would be good to have a resistance band which you can tie to one of the equipment or a tree nearby. </p>

                <img src="roosevelt-island-jpg.jpg" width="100%" height="40%"><p>Roosevelt Island is probably the only place in NYC where you can walk or run for 5 miles  without having to stop for traffic lights. The walking path  around the island takes about an hour and 15 minutes at the comfortable pace of 14 minutes per mile. The added benefit is breathing in sea air instead of auto exhaust.</p>

            <p>As the largest of the five boroughs, Queens has much to explore. A great place for outdoor workouts is the Socrates Sculpture Park which is across the river from Roosevelt Island. This is a small and rather serene place more conducive to yoga or pilates under the trees. In the summer months, there are free yoga and tai chi classes on Sundays. The park also has nice quiet corners overlooking the river for reading or just thinking. </p>
